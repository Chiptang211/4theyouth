4theYouth Testing Protocols

Our testing protocol involved building our prototype website and then running acceptance tests
to make sure that the user journey is functional and flows smoothly as intended. The acceptance
tests that we ran included creating an account and logging in, and checking if that login information
was remembered and stored. We were successful in utilizing a database to store this information and
implement the login functionality of our website. 

Our user testing involved getting potential users to test out our website by using its different 
functionalities and exploring its pages. This brought us some key insights on the user journey of 
our solution and how users interact with our website. We took this feedback and used it to improve
the look and feel of our website to shape a better user experience with 4theYouth.

For bugs that we ran into during development, we resolved them in accordance with their priority level.
This depended on how impactful each bug was to our website's functionality. Our top priority was to make
sure that our key features, such as creating and storing account information, were fully functional.
We would then re-test our pages and features to ensure that any bugs were properly fixed.
