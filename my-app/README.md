This project is dedicated towards the advancement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Quality Education.
Our team's goal is to build a website for a youth center that allows staff and parents to view schedules, plan events, and establish points of contact.
The website is a React app hosted on Firebase, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses a database to store user IDs for login functionality.
