4theYouth User Personas

User 1: Josh - Youth Center Staff Member
Josh is a camp counselor at the youth center. He logs into the website as a staff member and is greeted 
with the home page featuring the staff's weekly agenda and bulletin board. He sees on the agenda that 
he will be hosting Space Explorers Academy and Young Astronomers Night on the same day, so he plans to
reach out to another camp counselor for some help on that day. He checks the Events page to see which
of his fellow counselors do not have any events on that day, and realizes that Chip is also free to 
help out. He then uses Chip's listed email address to contact Chip and ask him for some help on the
day of his events. Using the scheduling information from 4theYouth's website, Josh was able to plan
and prepare for his events for the upcoming days.

User 2: Jane - Parent to Youth Center Child Attendee
Jane is the mother of a child attending the youth center. She logs into the website as a parent and reads
the staff bulletin board on the website's home page. She sees a notice about lost items being transported to
the office's lost and found, and remembers that her son recently lost his water bottle at camp. She clicks on
the Contact page to find the contact information of Josh, the counselor who posted the notice. She calls the 
number listed under Josh's name and asks if they have her son's lost water bottle at the lost and found.
Josh confirms that they have the water bottle, and Jane is able to go retrieve it the next day.
